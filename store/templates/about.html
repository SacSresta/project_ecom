                <p>My name is Diksha Gurung, and as an international student in Australia, I was inspired to showcase the vibrant culture of Nepal through its fashion. Basana is more than just a boutique; it’s a heartfelt tribute to my mother, affectionately known as "Basana." Her unwavering support has been my guiding light, reminding me of the importance of family and heritage.</p>
